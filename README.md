# judge-problems
This repository holds c++ algorithms that solve some judge problems. Using graph theory, greedy algorithms and back-tracking. 

#1 activities
This is a greedy algorithm that finds the maximum amount of activities that can be done, given an series of activities, without doing more than one at the same time. 

#3 kings_graph

#2 domino
This algorithm finds the least amount of dominoes to throw them all. 

#4 magic-cube 
This algorithm finds the magic cube, with order n, in the k position in lexicographical order

#5 modems

#Master branch 

Here we have the implementation of a binary tree structure and a trie structure.
